# Code Refactor Starter Code

## Challenge Description
This week's challenge is about accessibility and semantic structure.  Given some starter code, I was able to rework the CSS code by consolidating the selectors and properties and restructure the HTML to have better semantic structure.  I also created an alt attribute to all of the images for accessibility.
